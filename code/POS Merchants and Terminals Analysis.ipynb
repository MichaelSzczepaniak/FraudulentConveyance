    "### Backgound & Objective\n",
    "This analysis was motivated by an investiment a group of Americans made in a company that claimed it went out of buisness shortly after receiving funds from the group.  This company sold and serviced point-of-sales (POS) equipment such as credit and debit card processing machines to small and medium sized merchants throughout Canada.  The Americans suspected the company they had invested in had substantial assets and cashflow, but that the president of the company was attempting to avoid paying back the investors in spite of having the means to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Americans obtained a judgment against the company and conducted a [judgment debtor examination (JDE)](https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/courts/guides/After_Judgement_Guide_to_Getting_Results_EN.html#_Toc436642217) with the president.  One of the undertakings from the JDE was to provide data showing the monthly account activity for all the merchants and terminals the company had in its portfolio over a given time period.  The purpose of this analysis was to then investigate the likelihood that [fraudulant conveyance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraudulent_conveyance) had occurred and was originally done in Java.  The data being analyzed in this notebook was taken from the actual legal action that spanned from 2007 through 2013 utilizing a port of the original Java code over to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The data was originally provided as a collection of Microsoft Word files which were converted to and saved as straight ASCII text files to simplify the analysis.  Each of these data files can be found at [https://github.com/MichaelSzczepaniak/FraudulentConveyance/tree/master/data/rawOsMerchantReportsTxt](https://github.com/MichaelSzczepaniak/FraudulentConveyance/tree/master/data/rawOsMerchantReportsTxt).  These text files are considered the raw data from which the [preprocessing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14650/data-preprocessing) and the subsequent analysis was conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "As with most data analysis projects, most of the work involved preprocessing the data to get it into a usable form.  Preprocessing roughly followed these steps:\n",

    "2. more stuff\n",
